# day-planner

## Deployed Application: https://banuayozturk.github.io/day-planner/
## Description: 

In this project I worked on a day-planner which I can save daily events in time-blocks. User can detect upcoming, past and present events easily because time-blocks are color-coded. Also current day and current hour is displayed at the top of the calender.

With this project, I aimed to learn and apply Jquery  and Bootstrap. I might say that experiencing the advantages of the third part apis have been educative.
